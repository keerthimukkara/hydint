Given Question:
Please solve this problem to be considered for this role. https://dharani.telangana.gov.in/knowLandStatus has 4 drop-downs for district, Mandal, village, and survey number. Each district/village/mandal combination gives a list of survey numbers. Write a Python program that will print the survey numbers given a district, mandal, and village. Push your code to GitHub and share the github link.
Solution:
To solve this problem, we can use web scraping techniques along with the 'requests' library in Python to fetch the required data from the website. Additionally, we can use the 'BeautifulSoup' library to parse the HTML content and extract the survey numbers based on the selected district, mandal, and village.
